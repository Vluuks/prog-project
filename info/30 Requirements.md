# Application requirements

Here we list the requirements that all submitted projects should accomodate. *Functional requirements* define the scope of the projects, and *Implementation details* help us more easily test your application and make it useful to a broad audience.

## Functional requirements

### Mobile apps

- You are invited to create an app concept of your own choosing, as long as it allows an app of sufficient complexity to be created (pending approval of the course's instructor).

- The product embodies good interaction design practices.

- The app solves a human problem.

### Data visualizations

- You are invited to work on a data set of your choosing, as long as it allows a visualization of sufficient complexity to be created (pending approval of the course's instructor).

- The product embodies good visualization practices.

- The visualization has a story telling aspect.

## Implementation details

### Android

- The application should have a minimum SDK API level of 7. You may use a later version if and only if some feature important to your project requires it. If this is the case, you may modify your project to use a later API version but you must mark in your source code, using Java comments, the precise line that requires the API version you are using. Be sure the text API CHANGE appears in your comment so that we can easily find it via a search.

- Under no circumstances should we be able to cause your program to crash at runtime.

- You may select your own project and application name. Your project's **package name** should be prefixed with `nl.mprog.`.

- You must include your name, email, and student ID in a comment atop every Java source file in the project.

### iOS

- Your app's UI should be sized for an iPhone or iPod touch (i.e., 320 &times; 480 points) or for an iPad (i.e., 768 &times; 1024 points).

- Under no circumstances should we be able to cause your program to crash at runtime.

- Your project's **Product Name** may be anything. Your project's **Company Identifier** should be `nl.mprog`.

- Your app must use Automatic Reference Counting (ARC).

- Your app must tolerate low-memory warnings (as by reloading views when needed).

- Your app must work within the iPhone 8 Simulator; you need not test it on actual hardware.

### Web based visualization

- Your visualization is built using client-side techniques working in at least one current generation browser (Chrome or Firefox are recommended).

- Under no circumstances should we be able to cause your program to crash at runtime.
