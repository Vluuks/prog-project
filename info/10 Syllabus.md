# Programmeerproject

*Winter 2016 (mind you: this page is not final)*

The programming project is the final course of the programming minor, and for the first time, you'll be able to create your very own piece of software from scratch. With this experience, we hope to enable you to independently study computer science or simply go out in the world and start creating your own software.

Please send your e-mails to <help@mprog.nl>, but more importantly, ask questions during daily meetings!

## Deliverables

In this course, you will create a single software project, based on the platform knowledge you acquired in previous courses. You will deliver this project by way of milestones:

- proposal (day 1)
- design document and prototype (day 5)
- incomplete alpha version (day 10)
- complete beta version (day 15)
- final version (day 19)
- product demonstration (day 20)

## Expectations

You are expected to:

- keep track of your progress, bottlenecks and solutions in a process book
- work at the lab in a team of 5 students who are doing similar projects as you
- share ideas and knowledge liberally, so as to help other students out with their projects
- deliver a fully functional application, though possibly limited in options, at the end of the course
- put all your work, including code and documentation, on GitHub
- keep a version history of `git` commits of your project that documents daily progress
- make liberal use of forums, blog posts and other web pages to obtain knowledge needed to implement your application
- cite, in a section of your project's README, any sources you use

Note: the project cannot be done on the basis of existing code, under external supervision and/or in exchange for compensation by third parties, at any time. It is, however, possible to do such a project outside of this course. Please contact the course's instructor to discuss.

## Activies

*Daily stand-up* --- You will be part of a group of five students who work on similar projects. Each day at 10 in the morning, you will have a stand-up meeting to discuss progress. Every group member highlights the work of the previous day, plans for today, and potential problems ahead. From time to time, stand-ups will be visited by instructors or assistants.

*Friday presentations* --- You will also be part of a larger group with an assigned *mentor* who will guide and coach you during the project. An important part of this is the weekly presentation on Friday where you will update your group on current progress.

*Code reviews* --- Every Wednesday from the second week on, you will perform a systematic review of the codebase of one of your team members. You will get a list of topics to help you focus your feedback. This will help you, and your team members, to deliver better code as part of the final application.

*Guest lectures* --- Where possible, some guest lectures will be scheduled. These lectures will help you get ideas on how to make your project even better and what to do when the projects are over. As a general rule, you need to attend them all.

*Process book* --- Together with your completed software project, you will hand in a process book that documents the development process as well as the finalized application. This will help us grade your project.

*Product presentation* --- The final part of this course is the exhibition, where you are expected to demo your finished project to other students, family, friends and the teaching staff. This exhibition will take place on Friday 30 January, in the afternoon.

## Assessment

Your grade for this course will be determined on the basis of five criteria:

*Process book* --- To what extent have you clearly documented your project, the design, and your understanding of the chosen topic? The process book will be graded on axes of clarity and thoroughness.

*Process* --- To what extent have you followed a rigorous design and development process and have you worked with others to enhance your and their learning? The process will be grades on the basis of peer assessment and on evaluation of rigor as evidenced in your process book.

*Solution* --- To what extent does your project implement the features as agreed upon, and is it useful for your intended audience? The solution will be graded primarily on usefulness and coherence.

*Implementation* --- To what extent is your project consistent with the general project requirements and is it free of bugs? The implementation will be checked on general requirements and graded on buggyness by rigorous stress testing. 

*Code* --- To what extent is your code well-designed and readable? The code quality will be graded usign a code quality rubric that you will also use yourself during the weekly code reviews.

Do note that failing to meet expectations, as stated in an earlier section, will generally result in a failing grade.

## Deadlines

Extensions on projects, documentation and set-up are not granted, except in cases of emergency. Technical difficulties do not constitute emergencies. If you ask for an exception *after* the deadline we require that you see a student advisor.

Projects submitted *n* hours late may be penalized by 10% for *n* in (0, 24], by 25% for *n* in (24, 48], by 50% for *n* in (48, 72], and by 100% for *n* greater than 72. Lateness will be determined by submissions' timestamps.

## Attendance

You are expected to attend every project day (20 days) between 9:30 and 16:30. You are allowed to miss 10% of this time during the course, but you must in any case attend:

- the first Monday
- every Friday presentation session
- every daily stand-up

In cases of emergency, please inform the instructors immediately to make arrangements on finishing the course.
