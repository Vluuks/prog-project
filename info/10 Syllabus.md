*June 2015*

The programming project is the final course of the programming minor, and for the first time, you'll be able to create your very own piece of software from scratch. With this experience, we hope to enable you to independently study computer science or go simply out in the world and start creating your own software.

## Expectations

You only have four weeks to complete this course, so deadlines are tight. Here's what we expect you to do in those four weeks:

### Create your own software project ###

Most of the time you will be writing code to create a visualization tool or mobile app. Above all, we expect your application to solve some kind of clearly defined problem for the user(s). At the end of the month, you need to delived a *fully functional* application that solves that problem.

### Attend daily meetings and Friday presentations ###

You will be assigned a *mentor* who you will meet every morning at 10:00 together with at about 10 other students. During this daily standup meeting you are expected to briefly report on progress and share your plans for the day. This provides you with an opportunity to see if other students will be tackling the same problem as you, and work together on said problem.

Each Friday, you are expected to present to your mentor and fellow students the progress you have made on your application.

### Perform three code reviews and post GitHub issues ###

Every Wednesday from the second week on, you will perform a systematic review of the codebase of one of your team members. You will get a list of topics to help you focus your feedback.

### Prepare yourself by reading documentation, sharing, and attending workshops ###

Creating software consists of reading documentation as much as it consists of writing code. During this project, you will be on your own most of the time. Hence, you need to prepare yourself daily by reading up on concepts that you will apply and on problems that you encounter.

We also expect you to liberally share your knowledge with other students and at the same time ask lots of questions. For some topics that pertain to most students, there will be small workshops taught by the staff. We expect you to attend these if you need to.

### Attend guest lectures ###

During the month, some guest lectures will take place. These lectures will help you get ideas on how to make your project even better and what to do when the projects are over. Lectures normally take place at 14:00 in the afternoon. You are allowed to miss one of these lectures, but as a general rule, you need to attend them all.

### Create a process book documenting your project ###

Together with your completed software project, you will hand in a process book that documents the development process as well as the finalized application. This will help us grade your project.

Besides that, it will guide you through the process of implementation. That is why in the first week, you will spend quite some time creating a first version of the process book.

### Present your project at the end of the course ###

The final part of this course is the exhibition, where you are expected to demo your finished project to other students, family, friends and the teaching staff. This exhibition will take place on Friday 30 January, in the afternoon.

## Assessment

Your proposal and process book will be evaluated on the bases of, at least, clarity and thoroughness. Your implementation will be evaluated along four axes primarily:

*Process book*
: To what extent have you clearly documented your project, the design, and your understanding of the chosen topic?

*Solution*
: To what extent does your code implement the features as agreed upon and is it useful for your intented audience?

*Implementation*
: To what extent is your code consistent with the requirements, free of bugs, and is your code well-designed and readable?

## Schedule

*Proposal and technical set-up*
: due by Tue 2 June at 23:59

*Design document and prototype user interface*
: due by Fri 5 June at noon

*Beta version*
: due by Fri 12 June at noon

*Minimum viable product*
: due by Fri 19 June at noon

*Final release*
: due by Fri 26 June at 11:00 AM

*Exhibition*
: from 13:00--17:00 on Fri 26 June

## Deadlines

Extensions on projects, documentation and set-up are not granted, except in cases of emergency. Technical difficulties do not constitute emergencies. If you ask for an exception *after* the deadline we require that you see a student advisor.

Projects submitted n hours late may be penalized by 10% for n in (0, 24], by 25% for n in (24, 48], by 50% for n in (48, 72], and by 100% for n greater than 72. Lateness will be determined by submissions' timestamps.
