This is the final project. Your way out. Or your way in. Your masterpiece.

## Overview

The programming project is the final course of the programming minor, and for the first time, you'll be able to create your very own piece of software from scratch. With this experience, we hope to enable you to independently study computer science or go out in the world and start creating your own software.

## To do

### Create your own software project

### Attend many guest lectures

### Present your project at the end of the course




## Assessment

Your pre-proposal, proposal, and status report will be evaluated on the bases of, at least, clarity and thoroughness. Your implementation will be evaluated along four axes primarily:

Scope
: To what extent does your code implement the features required by our specification?

Correctness
: To what extent is your code consistent with our specifications and free of bugs?

Design
: To what extent is your code written well (i.e., clearly, efficiently, elegantly, and/or logically)?

Style
: To what extent is your code readable (i.e., commented and indented with variables aptly named)?
