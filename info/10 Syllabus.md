# Programmeerproject<br><small>Studiewijzer</small>

*Winter 2017*

The programming project is the final course of the programming minor, and for the first time, you'll be able to create your very own piece of software from scratch. With this experience, we hope to enable you to independently study computer science or go out in the world and start creating your own software.

## Course plan

In this course, you will create a single software project, based on the platform knowledge you acquired in previous courses: iOS, Android or JS/D3. Your task is to deliver a fully functional and useful application at the end of the course.

Your application will be developed with help of the following milestones:

- Monday: proposal
- Wednesday: design document
- Friday: prototype
- Second Friday: incomplete alpha version
- Third Friday: complete beta version
- Fourth Thursday: final version and report
- Fourth Friday: product demonstration

## Activities

*Stand-up* --- In the first week, you will start your day with a stand-up meeting to discuss progress with about four teammates. Every group member highlights the work of the previous day, plans for today, and potential problems ahead. Stand-ups might be visited by instructors or assistants.

*Hour of code* --- In all other weeks, the day starts with a feedback session where every aspect of your application might be vetted: the concept, the interaction design, as well as the code itself. These sessions are meant to help one another and include constructive feedback.

*Lab sessions* --- As expected in a project course, most of your day will be spent designing and coding up your application. In the afternoons, assistance will be available from the course's staff, who consult on design decisions and  provide feedback on ideas or code.

*Friday presentations* --- You will also be part of a larger group with an assigned *mentor* who will guide and coach you during the project. An important part of this is the weekly presentation on Friday where you will update your group on current progress.

*Process book* --- Together with your completed software project, you will hand in a process book that documents the development process as well as the finalized application. It contains your daily resume of design decisions and other considerations.

*Product presentation* --- The final part of this course is the exhibition, where you are expected to demo your finished project to other students, family, friends and the teaching staff. This exhibition will take place on Friday 3 Februari, in the afternoon.

## Expectations

You are expected to participate in these course activities:

- keep track of your progress, bottlenecks and solutions in a process book
- work daily at the lab in a team of 4 to 5 students who are doing similar projects as you
- attend daily standups and the hour of code every workday
- share ideas and knowledge liberally, so as to help other students out with their projects
- deliver a fully functional application, though possibly limited in options, at the end of the course
- put all your work, including code and documentation, on GitHub
- keep a version history of `git` commits of your project that documents your daily progress
- make liberal use of forums, blog posts and other web pages to obtain knowledge needed to implement your application
- cite, in a section of your project's README, and in comments, any sources you use, especially if it concerns borrowing code

> Note: the project cannot be done 1) on the basis of an existing codebase, 2) under external supervision and/or 3) in exchange for any compensation by third parties, at any time. It might, however, be possible to do such a project outside of this course. Please contact the course's instructor to discuss.

## Attendance

You are expected to attend every project day (20 days) between 10:00 and 16:00. You are allowed to miss 10% of this time during the course, but you must in any case attend:

- the first Monday (because of the first deadline)
- every Friday presentation session

In cases of emergency, please inform the instructors immediately to make arrangements on finishing the course. In many cases, this will entail finishing the course in the following semester.

## Assessment

Your grade for this course will be determined on the basis of five criteria:

*Final report* --- To what extent have you clearly documented your project, the design, and your understanding of the chosen topic? The report will be graded on axes of clarity and thoroughness.

*Process* --- To what extent have you followed a rigorous design and development process and have you worked with others to enhance your and their learning? The process will be grades on the basis of peer assessment and on evaluation of rigor as evidenced in your process book.

*Solution* --- To what extent does your project implement the features as agreed upon, and is it useful for your intended audience? The solution will be graded primarily on usefulness, coherence and interaction design.

*Implementation* --- To what extent is your project consistent with the general project requirements and is it free of bugs? The implementation will be graded on functional requirements and on buggyness by rigorous stress testing.

*Code* --- To what extent is your code well-designed and readable? The code quality will be graded using a code quality rubric that will also be used during the daily Hour of Code.

On each of these criteria, you will receive a grade 1--5:

1. Poor
2. Fair: ample room for improvement
3. Good: some room for improvement
4. Very good: minor room for improvement
5. Excellent: essentially no room for improvement

Failing to meet expectations as mentioned will generally result in a failing grade for the course.

## Deadlines and late submissions

Extensions on projects, documentation and set-up are not granted, except in cases of emergency. Technical difficulties do not constitute emergencies. If you ask for an exception *after* a deadline we require that you see a student advisor.

Projects submitted *n* hours late may be penalized by 10% for *n* in (0, 24], by 25% for *n* in (24, 48], by 50% for *n* in (48, 72], and by 100% for *n* greater than 72. Lateness will be determined by submissions' timestamps.
