# Product requirements

Here we list the requirements that all submitted projects should accommodate. *Functional requirements* define the scope of the projects, and *Implementation details* help us more easily test your application and make it useful to a broad audience.

## Functional requirements

### Mobile apps

- You are invited to create an app concept of your own choosing, as long as it allows an app of sufficient complexity to be created (pending approval by the course's instructor).

- The product embodies good interaction design practices.

- The app solves a human problem.

- Your app should implement MVC

### Data visualizations

- You are invited to work on a data set of your choosing, as long as it allows a visualization of sufficient complexity to be created (pending approval by the course's instructor).

- The product embodies good visualization practices.

- The visualization has a story telling aspect.

- You must implement at least 3 linked interactive visual componens.

- Also implement at least 2 other interactive components (e.g. table, dropdown, checkbox, etc.).

## Implementation details

### Android

- Your app's source code should be managed in an *Android Studio* project.

- Your app should target a recent version of the Android SDK and need not be backwards compatible.

- Under no circumstances should we be able to cause your program to crash at runtime. Staff is quite good at finding "crash opportunities".

- You may select your own project and application name.

- Your app must use Java as the source code language.

- Your app must work within the simulator; you need not test it on actual hardware.

- You must include your name in a comment atop every source file in the project (unless re-using a source file from another project).

### iOS

- Your app's source code should be managed in an *Xcode 8* project.

- Your app's UI should be sized for an iPhone or iPod touch (i.e., 320 &times; 480 points) or for an iPad (i.e., 768 &times; 1024 points).

- Under no circumstances should we be able to cause your program to crash at runtime. Staff is quite good at finding "crash opportunities".

- You may select your own project and application name.

- Your app must use Swift as the source code language.

- Your app must tolerate low-memory warnings (as by reloading views when needed).

- Your app must work within the simulator; you need not test it on actual hardware.

- You must include your name in a comment atop every source file in the project (unless re-using a source file from another project).

### Web based visualization

- Your visualization is built using client-side techniques working in at least one current generation browser (Chrome or Firefox are recommended).

- Your visualization must be implemented in D3 (use of additional libraries must be approved by an instructor).

- Under no circumstances should we be able to cause your program to crash at runtime. Staff is quite good at finding "crash opportunities".

- You must include your name in a comment atop every source file in the project.
