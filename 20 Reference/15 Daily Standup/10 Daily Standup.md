# Daily Standup

Each day, you will provide a progress update to your team. Such a meeting will be quite short, but it has an important objective: making sure that every member of your team knows what you will be working on and vice-versa. This way, you can later discuss problems that you encounter, especially if you plan on doing the same kind of development that day!

Be sure to hold this meeting every day at 10 o'clock! We want everyone to be aware of their team's work. Watch this video for a short overview of good standup meetings.
