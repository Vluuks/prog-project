# Daily Standup

Each day, you will provide a progress update to your team. Such a meeting will often be fairly brief, but it has an important objective: making sure that every member of your team knows what you will be working on and vice-versa. This way, you can later discuss problems that you encounter, especially if you plan on doing the same kind of development that day!

Standups are a practice that supports "agile" software development in teams. Generally speaking, this means iteratively developing an understanding of the problem being solved (e.g., what kind of system will really help this company?), while creating more and more refined solutions for that problem. In such a process, daily standup are an important factor in team communication. It is a time to summarize what has been done and to theorize what needs to be done, all so that teammates can help each other better understand the problem at hand.

(Usually, agile methods are being used when teams work on the same problem. You, however, will be working on your own projects. This does not matter for daily standups.)

## Every day

Be sure to hold this meeting every day at 10 o'clock! We want everyone to be aware of their team's work. Watch this video for a short overview of good standup meetings.

## Reporting back

Every standup, you must provide a brief report on what has been discussed. It is fine if one of you types the report. The report must always include a fresh group photo!

## Week 1

In Week 1, use the following themes during your standup meetings:

- Day 3: present your proposal (show your proposal on GitHub) and feedback each other on what's missing, why it is a good concept or what could be done to make it better
- Day 4: show your technical design and explain what you will have to research to get your app working

## Week 2

- Day 1: present your plans for the week, what is realistic?
- Day 2: show your progress from Monday
- Day 3: take an hour or so to create a style guide with your team!
- Day 4: finish the style guide, making sure that every has had the opportunity to prodide input

## Week 3 ##

- Day 1: present your plans for the week, what is realistic?

- Day 3: everyone shows the team their repo and gets open feedback; the goal is to find out if the repo structure and class structure are easy to understand
- Day 4: everyone tells about their progress and the others help make a realistic plan for finalizing functionality or cutting features

## Week 4

- Day 1: present your plans for the week, what is realistic?
- Day 2: show your progress from Monday
- Day 3: everyone shows their code, browsing around; others quickly provide feedback on the quality of the code (var. names, method names, comments, etc)
- Day 4: everyone provides an update and makes a decision of what to submit and what to delete (if needed). others help!
