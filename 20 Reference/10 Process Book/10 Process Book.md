An important part of your project is your process book. Your process book details your steps in developing your solution, including the alternative designs you tried, and the insights you got. Develop your process book out of the project proposal. Equally important to your final results is how you got there! Your process book is the place you describe and document the space of possibilities you explored at each step of your project. It is not, however, a journal or lab notebook that describes every detail - you should think carefully about the important decisions you made and insights you gained and present your reasoning in a concise way.

We strongly advise you to include many figures in your process book, including photos of your sketches of potential designs, screen shots from different visualization tools you explored, inspirations of visualizations you found online, etc. Several images illustrating changes in your design or focus over time will be far more informative than text describing those changes. Instead, use text to describe the rationale behind the evolution of your project.

Your process book should include the following topics. Depending on your project type the amount of discussion you devote to each of them will vary:

Overview and Motivation: Provide an overview of the project goals and the motivation for it. Consider that this will be read by people who did not see your project proposal.
Related Work: Anything that inspired you, such as a paper, a web site, visualizations we discussed in class, etc.
Questions: What questions are you trying to answer? How did these questions evolve over the course of the project? What new questions did you consider in the course of your analysis?
Data: Source, scraping method, cleanup, etc.
Exploratory Data Analysis: What visualizations did you use to initially look at your data? What insights did you gain? How did these insights inform your design?
Design Evolution: What are the different visualizations you considered? Justify the design decisions you made using the perceptual and design principles you learned in the course. Did you deviate from your proposal?
Implementation: Describe the intent and functionality of the interactive visualizations you implemented. Provide clear and well-referenced images showing the key design and interaction elements.
Evaluation: What did you learn about the data by using your visualizations? How did you answer your questions? How well does your visualization work, and how could you further improve it?
As this will be your only chance to describe your project in detail make sure that your process book is a standalone document that fully describes your results and the final design. Here are a few examples of process books from previous years. Note that those process books do not follow the exact structure layed out here, they are meant as inspiration and are not necessarily indicative of the format and scope of your project.

### Process book ###

Create a first version of your `process book`. This document will describe any decisions that you made during the project. Such a document will help you tremendously in writing a final report!

*Put the process book on a wiki page of your GitHub repository.*


## Process book (every day)

From today on, you'll need to log your activities in a process book. Create a page in the wiki called "Process book" and add headings for each day that you're working on your project.

- Add bullets for all your activities during the day.

- Make note of decisions that you make, e.g. where you deviate from the proposal or the design document.

Doing this will make it easier to write your report, and we also use it during grading, to see if there were obvious problems we should know about.

*Put your process but on the wiki, not in a file in your repository.*


## Process book (every day)

Remember to update your process book every day. Add headings for each day that you're working on your project. Add bullets for all activities during the day, and note important decisions that you have made.
