### Process book ###

Create a first version of your `process book`. This document will describe any decisions that you made during the project. Such a document will help you tremendously in writing a final report!

*Put the process book on a wiki page of your GitHub repository.*


## Process book (every day)

From today on, you'll need to log your activities in a process book. Create a page in the wiki called "Process book" and add headings for each day that you're working on your project.

- Add bullets for all your activities during the day.

- Make note of decisions that you make, e.g. where you deviate from the proposal or the design document.

Doing this will make it easier to write your report, and we also use it during grading, to see if there were obvious problems we should know about.

*Put your process but on the wiki, not in a file in your repository.*


## Process book (every day)

Remember to update your process book every day. Add headings for each day that you're working on your project. Add bullets for all activities during the day, and note important decisions that you have made.
