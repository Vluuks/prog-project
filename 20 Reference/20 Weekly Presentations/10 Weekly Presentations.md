# Weekly presentations

You are to present your progress on all Fridays, thereby using the materials, prototypes and
preliminary results.

## Week 1

Prepare a short demo of the different mockup screens. Then, show how the application will be
built technically. Make sure you introduce your product briefly at the start of the presentation (the group will be larger than during the daily standups so not everyone will remember exactly what you're making!).

## Week 2

Prepare a short demo of the currently finished features. Tell the audience what you
will be doing to finish the core functionality next week. Make sure you introduce your product briefly at the start of the presentation.

## Week 3

Prepare a short demo of the minimum viable product that you have created and explain what you
will be doing to finish and finetune the application next week. Make sure you introduce your product briefly at the start of the presentation.
