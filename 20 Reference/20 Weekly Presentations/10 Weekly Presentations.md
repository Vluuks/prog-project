# Weekly presentations

You are to formally present your progress on all Fridays! This will be done in larger groups, so many of the students will not have followed your progress during the week. Adapt your demo accordingly!

## Week 1

Make sure you introduce your project briefly at the start of the presentation,
so everyone knows what you are talking about. (You should simply show the
**README** on GitHub.) Then, give a short demo of the prototype and explain how
how the application will be built technically. Finally, mention the big things
that you still have to investigate, and what will be difficult about your
project.

Every student has at most 7 minutes. PowerPoint is not allowed!

## Week 2

Prepare a short demo of the currently finished features. Tell the audience what
you will be doing to finish the core functionality next week. Make sure you
introduce your product briefly at the start of the presentation.

## Week 3

Prepare a short demo of the minimum viable product that you have created and
explain what you will be doing to finish and finetune the application next
week. Make sure you introduce your product briefly at the start of the
presentation.
