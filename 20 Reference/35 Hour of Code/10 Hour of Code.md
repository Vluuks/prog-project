## Hour of Code

Every day, we'll start off on a serious note and review the project and code of 2--3 students. The class will ask questions about the project, and suggest ideas that may make the project a lot better. The sessions are supposed to be extremely helpful and friendly in nature: we all become reponsible for the success of others' projects.

We might ask questions about the concept:

- what interesting information is still hidden in your dataset?
- how does the application actually solve a problem?

Or about the technical structure:

- external dependencies: what options do you have, which one to choose?
- code frameworks: what options do you have, which one to choose?
- what is the structure of your model classes?
- what does your database design look like?

About the code:

- are classes and methods not too long?
- aren't there to many classes to get a good grasp of the structure?
- can we 

Or about the user interface:

- can the user get a good overview of what their options are?
- does everything do what you would expect it to?
- are the affordances of high quality?
