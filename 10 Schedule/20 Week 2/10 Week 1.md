## Process book (every day)

From today on, you'll need to log your activities in a process book. Create a new page in the wiki called "Process book" and add headings for each day that you're working on your project. Add bullets for all activities during the day.

## Pushing code (every day)

`git commit` and `git push` every day!

## Code reviews (on Wednesday)

You'll team up with another student and perform code reviews on each other's code. Make sure your repository is cleaned up and ready before Wednesday at noon, and then do the code reviews. Pay attention to:

- How easy it is to make sense of the complete code base (can you understand what goes where and why?). Think aloud when doing this, so the coder under review can take notes and make their code better.

- Stylistic issues in the code. Make sure that you point out the weak spots. These need to be fixed, especially before the final release (but also before the next code review!).

## Creating a beta version of your project (deadline: Friday)

This week, you'll work towards presenting a beta version of your project. Make sure that you have all your data ready this week, and create a basic representation of the data, with some interaction.

## Update your design document (deadline: Friday)

Update your design document with any decisions that you've made during the week.

### Submitting

You will need to submit your prototype code by *push*ing it to GitHub. Your
design document should be an evolution of the proposal in the project Wiki.
(GitHub wikis track changes, so we can always look at older versions if needed.)

To allow us to find the repository, you need to submit the *https clone URL* on the submit tab of this web page:

### Presenting

You are to present your progress on Friday, thereby using the materials and
beta version you have created. To make your fellow students and your mentor
fully understand what you will be building, prepare a very short demo of the
different mockup screens. Then, show how the application will be built
technically.
