## Process book (every day)

From today on, you'll need to log your activities in a process book. Create a page in the wiki called "Process book" and add headings for each day that you're working on your project.

- Add bullets for all your activities during the day.

- Make note of decisions that you make, e.g. where you deviate from the proposal or the design document.

Doing this will make it easier to write your report, and we also use it during grading, to see if there were obvious problems we should know about.

*Put your process but on the wiki, not in a file in your repository.*

## Pushing code (every day)

`git commit` and `git push` every day!

## Code reviews (on Wednesday)

You'll team up with another student and perform code reviews on each other's code. Make sure your repository is cleaned up and ready before Wednesday at 12 (noon), and then do the code reviews.

1. Pick a partner. You will perform three code reviews (one each week), each with a different partner.

2. Open your project on your computer and put your partner in front of it. Your partner should navigate the code, not you!

3. Your partner will now comment (aloud!) on your code. You will listen. If there are questions, do answer them. If there are questions, this may be where your project could be better documented, or where your code could be more clear!

The reviewer must pay attention to:

- How easy it is to make sense of the complete code base (can you understand what goes where and why?). Think aloud when doing this, so the coder under review can take notes and make their code better.

- Stylistic issues in the code. Make sure that you point out the weak spots. These need to be fixed, especially before the final release (but also before the next code review!).

Doing this will help you and your partner learn, and obtain higher grades, depending on how well you perform the review!

Note: your will not actually *run* the code during the code review! That is not what this is about.

## Creating an alpha version of your project (deadline: Friday)

This week, you'll work towards presenting an alpha version of your project. Make sure that you have all your data ready this week, and that there is basic interaction, core functionality is mostly implemented (but probably buggy!).

### Submitting

You will need to submit your alpha code by *push*ing it to GitHub, as you have done every day. No need to update your proposal or design document. Any deviations should be documented in your process book!

### Presenting

You are to present your progress on Friday, thereby using the materials and
alpha version you have created. To make your fellow students and your mentor
fully understand what you will be building, prepare a very short demo of the
different mockup screens. Then, show how the application is built
technically.
