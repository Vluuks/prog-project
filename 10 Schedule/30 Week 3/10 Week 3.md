## Process book (every day)

Remember to update your process book every day. Add headings for each day that you're working on your project. Add bullets for all activities during the day.

## Pushing code (every day)

`git commit` and `git push` every day!

## Code reviews (on Wednesday)

You'll team up with another student and perform code reviews on each other's code. Make sure your repository is cleaned up and ready before Wednesday at noon, and then do the code reviews. Pay attention to:

- How easy it is to make sense of the complete code base (can you understand what goes where and why?). Think aloud when doing this, so the coder under review can take notes and make their code better.

- Stylistic issues in the code. Make sure that you point out the weak spots. These need to be fixed, especially before the final release (but also before the next code review!).

## Delivering the minimum viable product (deadline: Friday)

This week, you'll work towards presenting the MVP of your project. Make sure that your data processing tools work and that you have a *working* product, even though it need not be finished in terms of features and code quality.

## Update your design document (deadline: Friday)

Update your design document with any decisions that you've made during the week.

### Submitting

You will need to submit your MVP code by *push*ing it to GitHub. Your
design document should be an evolution of the proposal in the project Wiki.
(GitHub wikis track changes, so we can always look at older versions if needed.)

### Presenting

You are to present your progress on Friday, thereby using the MVP that you have
created. To make your fellow students and your mentor fully understand what you
will be building, prepare a very short demo of the currently finished features and plan to tell the audience what you consider doing to finish the application.
