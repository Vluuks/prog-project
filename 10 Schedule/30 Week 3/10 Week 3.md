## Process book (every day)

Remember to update your process book every day. Add headings for each day that you're working on your project. Add bullets for all activities during the day, and note important decisions that you have made.

## Pushing code (every day)

`git commit` and `git push` every day!

## Code reviews (on Wednesday)

You'll team up with another student and perform code reviews on each other's code. Make sure your repository is cleaned up and ready before Wednesday at 12 (noon), and then do the code reviews.

1. Pick a partner. You will perform three code reviews (one each week), each with a different partner.

2. Open your project on your computer and put your partner in front of it. Your partner should navigate the code, not you!

3. Your partner will now comment (aloud!) on your code. You will listen. If there are questions, do answer them. If there are questions, this may be where your project could be better documented, or where your code could be more clear!

The reviewer must pay attention to:

- How easy it is to make sense of the complete code base (can you understand what goes where and why?). Think aloud when doing this, so the coder under review can take notes and make their code better.

- Stylistic issues in the code. Make sure that you point out the weak spots. These need to be fixed, especially before the final release (but also before the next code review!).

Doing this will help you and your partner learn, and obtain higher grades, depending on how well you perform the review!

Note: your will not actually *run* the code during the code review! That is not what this is about.

## Delivering the beta minimum viable product (deadline: Friday)

This week, you'll work towards presenting the beta of your project. Make sure that you have a fully *working* product, even though it need not be finished in terms of small bugs and code quality. You cannot add new functionality after today!

### Submitting

You will need to submit your beta code by *push*ing it to GitHub, as usual.

### Presenting

You are to present your progress on Friday, thereby using the beta version that
you have created. To make your fellow students and your mentor fully understand
what you will be building, prepare a very short demo of the currently finished
features and plan to tell the audience what you will be doing to finish the
application.
