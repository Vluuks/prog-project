## Pushing code (every day)

`git commit` and `git push` every day!

## Creating an alpha version of your project

This week, you'll work towards presenting an alpha version of your project. Make sure that you have all your data ready this week, and that there is basic interaction, core functionality is mostly implemented (but probably buggy!).

### Submitting

You will need to submit your alpha code by *push*ing it to GitHub, as you have done every day. No need to update your proposal or design document. Any deviations should be documented in your process book (this will help tremendously when writing your final report)!
