## Create the final report (deadline: Friday 11 AM)

Create a report (**REPORT.md**), based on your design document, containing important decisions that you've made, e.g. where you changed your mind during the past weeks. This is how you show the reviewer that you actually understand what you have done.

- Start with a short description of your application (like in the **README**)

- Clearly describe the technical design: how does your code map to the functionality?

- Clearly describe challenges that your have met during development. Document all important changes that your have made with regard to your design document.

- Try to defend these decisions by writing a small argument. Why was it good to do it different than you thought before? Are there trade-offs?

- Make sure the document is complete and reflects the final state of the application. The document will be an important part of your grade.

Have students reflect by giving them several questions about their project that they need to answer.
Students must answer these questions in paragraph form, writing at least one paragraph per question.
Paragraphs must be at least 5 sentences.
Tell students they all have to explain why in their answers.
Below are some sample reflection questions:
What went well with your project?
What was the most difficult part of your project?
How could you improve your project if you had more time to spend on it?
Are you satisfied with your project?
What advice would you give to someone else who was assigned this project?
Describe how you applied problem solving steps in this project.
Did you solve the original problem? How could the problem be solved differently?

(cs teaching tips Lynne Norris)

After students are finished with the content of the project, ask them to write or verbally explain how their project meets the requirements of the rubric.

Your process book should include the following topics. Depending on your project type the amount of discussion you devote to each of them will vary:

Overview and Motivation: Provide an overview of the project goals and the motivation for it. Consider that this will be read by people who did not see your project proposal.
Related Work: Anything that inspired you, such as a paper, a web site, visualizations we discussed in class, etc.
Questions: What questions are you trying to answer? How did these questions evolve over the course of the project? What new questions did you consider in the course of your analysis?
Data: Source, scraping method, cleanup, etc.
Exploratory Data Analysis: What visualizations did you use to initially look at your data? What insights did you gain? How did these insights inform your design?
Design Evolution: What are the different visualizations you considered? Justify the design decisions you made using the perceptual and design principles you learned in the course. Did you deviate from your proposal?
Implementation: Describe the intent and functionality of the interactive visualizations you implemented. Provide clear and well-referenced images showing the key design and interaction elements.
Evaluation: What did you learn about the data by using your visualizations? How did you answer your questions? How well does your visualization work, and how could you further improve it?
As this will be your only chance to describe your project in detail make sure that your process book is a standalone document that fully describes your results and the final design. Here are a few examples of process books from previous years. Note that those process books do not follow the exact structure layed out here, they are meant as inspiration and are not necessarily indicative of the format and scope of your project.
