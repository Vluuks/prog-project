## Create the final report (deadline: Friday 11 AM)

Create a report (**REPORT.md**), based on your design document, containing important decisions that you've made, e.g. where you changed your mind during the past weeks. This is how you show the reviewer that you actually understand what you have done.

- Start with a short description of your application (like in the **README**)

- Clearly describe the technical design: how does your code map to the functionality?

- Clearly describe challenges that your have met during development. Document all important changes that your have made with regard to your design document.

- Try to defend these decisions by writing a small argument. Why was it good to do it different than you thought before? Are there trade-offs?

- Make sure the document is complete and reflects the final state of the application. The document will be an important part of your grade.

Have students reflect by giving them several questions about their project that they need to answer.
Students must answer these questions in paragraph form, writing at least one paragraph per question.
Paragraphs must be at least 5 sentences.
Tell students they all have to explain why in their answers.
Below are some sample reflection questions:
What went well with your project?
What was the most difficult part of your project?
How could you improve your project if you had more time to spend on it?
Are you satisfied with your project?
What advice would you give to someone else who was assigned this project?
Describe how you applied problem solving steps in this project.
Did you solve the original problem? How could the problem be solved differently?

After students are finished with the content of the project, ask them to write or verbally explain how their project meets the requirements of the rubric.
