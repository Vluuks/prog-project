## Creating a prototype of your application (deadline: Friday) ##



While further specifying the technical details of your application, you will
create a prototype of your applications's user interface. It can be changed in
the following weeks, but it should provide a good starting point for further
development. By creating a prototype this early, you can focus on more
fundamental problems in later weeks.

### Submitting

You will need to submit your prototype code by *push*ing it to GitHub. Your
design document should be an evolution of the proposal.

*Save your design document as `DESIGN.md` in the root of your GitHub repository.*

To allow us to find the repository, you need to submit the *https URL* on the submit tab of this web page (`https://github.com/username/projectname`).
