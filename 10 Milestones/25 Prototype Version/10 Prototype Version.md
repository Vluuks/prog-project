# Prototype version

You will now create a prototype of your applications's user interface. It will
probably change extensively in the following weeks, but doing this now should
provide a good starting point for further development. By creating a prototype
this early, you can focus on more fundamental problems in later weeks.

## Components

To create a fairly complete prototype, make sure that all screens are there and
navigation is working. Controls on screen should work and basic input and
output of data should be functional.

If you need data from an external source, you must have a working script to
import the data from a file or a working connection to the live data source.

Any data preprocessing scripts should be contained in an entirely separate
folder in your repository, called **scripts**.

## Repository

Commit and push all new code to GitHub. Don't forget to update your **README.md** if you have made any incompatible decisions, and push that file, too!
