# Prototype version

While further specifying the technical details of your application, you will create a prototype of
your applications's user interface. It can be changed in the following weeks, but doing this should
provide a good starting point for further development. By creating a prototype this early, you can
focus on more fundamental problems in later weeks.

## Components

To create a reasonably complete prototype, make sure that all screens are there and navigation is mostly working. You can probably put some of the components in already, even though the controls will have no effect as of yet.

## Data manipulation

If your application depends on a data set that needs to be generated, create preprocessing scripts that translate from the source format to a format useful for your application.

Such preprocessing scripts should be contained in an entirely separate folder in your repository, called **scripts**.

## Repository

Commit and push all new code to GitHub. Don't forget to update your **README.md** if you have made any incompatible decisions, and push that file, too!
