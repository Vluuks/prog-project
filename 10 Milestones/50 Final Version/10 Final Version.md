## Delivering the finished product (deadline: Thursday)

This week, you'll work towards submitting the final code of your project. Make sure that you have a *working* product to submit. If it does not work, it cannot be considered for grading.

## Changing the `README.md` and choosing a license for your work (deadline: Friday 11 AM)

Your GitHub repository should contain a complete **README.md** file that states the application name, a couple of screen shot (not too large!), its purpose, your name and a copyright statement. It should be easy to read.

The copyright statement can be either:

- a *public domain* release, which releases your code to the public without any restrictions (you could also use the *unlicense* for this)

- a *copyright notice* which states who actually owns the rights to the materials in the repository (probably only you)

Make sure that you have the correct license in your **LICENSE** file.

The **README.md** should also acknowledge sources of external code, images and other materials that are in the repository but not created by yourself. Make sure that it is clear which directories are copyrighted by different creators.

Also note that these materials have their own respective licenses. You should at the very least note this fact (again, in the **README.md**). Make sure you also check the licenses to see if you should make a special statement about the source of the materials.

## Create the final report (deadline: Friday 11 AM)

Create a report (**REPORT.md**), based on your design document, containing important decisions that you've made, e.g. where you changed your mind during the past weeks. This is how you show the reviewer that you actually understand what you have done.

- Start with a short description of your application (like in the **README**)

- Clearly describe the technical design: how does your code map to the functionality?

- Clearly describe challenges that your have met during development. Document all important changes that your have made with regard to your design document.

- Try to defend these decisions by writing a small argument. Why was it good to do it different than you thought before? Are there trade-offs?

- Make sure the document is complete and reflects the final state of the application. The document will be an important part of your grade.


### Submitting

You will need to submit your final code by *push*ing it to GitHub. Make sure you are not missing anything!

- the **README.md**
- the license in *LICENSE*
- the **DESIGN.md** (unchanged from week 1)
- a new **REPORT.md**
- the wiki page containing your process book
- a **docs** folder for the images in your documents
- a separate folder containing your project's code
- any configuration files like **.gitignore**

*Note the rules for late submissions on the homepage!*
