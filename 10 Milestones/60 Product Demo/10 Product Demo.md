## Demonstrations

You are to present your final product on Friday. To make your fellow students
and your mentor fully understand what you have built, prepare a brief demo of all relevant features. The demonstrations will be used to consider the *scope* of your project for grading.

Program:

- 9:00--10:00: guest talk by Felienne Hermans
- 10:00--15:00: demonstrations by group
- 15:00--17:00: drinks, snacks and goodbyes!
