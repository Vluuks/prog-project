## Demonstrations (on Friday)

You are to present your final product on Friday. To make your fellow students
and your mentor fully understand what you have built, prepare a very
short demo of all relevant features. The demonstrations will be used to consider the *scope* of your project for grading.

Program:

- some groups have to do official demos between 9--11 (team Hella, team Jasper)
- 11:00 intro
- 11:15 guest talk by Marko Kruijer from Fabrique
- 12:30 lunch
- 13:00 demos: official demo for your grade + public demos for everyone
- 17:00 drinks
