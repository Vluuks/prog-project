## Product demo on video

Part of the assessment of this course is making a video demonstrating your product's features. This needs to be in the form of a *screencast*, which combines a screen capture of you using your product with your voice explaining what you are doing and how the product works.

The recording of your demonstration will be used by the teachers and assistants to assess your final version. As soon as the course has ended, we will review all demos to see what functionality has been implemented and if there are no large problems.

The video doesn't have to be perfect! Most important is that is shows how all features work.

The video will not be publicly distributed without your permission (we would like to show the nicest videos to new students, but we will ask you after this course is finished!).

### Making an appointment

The video team (Marijn Jansen and Mirja Lagerwaard) is going to help you record your demo. You will need to make an appointment to do this. Your options are:

- Wednesday (June 28th)
- Thursday (June 29th)
- Friday (June 30th, only in the morning)

Please fill in your first and last name. The calendar for making the appointment can be found at [Doodle](http://doodle.com/poll/pnbnzkreit2pmptc).

Finally, add the appointment of the recording to your own calendar. Don't forget.

### Preparation

Prepare the demonstration of your final version and practice **as often as possible**. The following points should be mentioned during your demonstration:

* Make sure you introduce your project briefly at the start of the demonstration (showing the default screen of your product).
* Give a demonstration of each and every feature of the final version.
* Don't forget to show all features.

Your demo may be narrated in **Dutch** or **English**. Make sure your demonstration **does not take longer than 7 minutes**. PowerPoint or other tools are not allowed, just show the product.

### Be on time!

... otherwise we will not be able to help you to record your demonstration.

### The recording

The location of the recording is **@SP A1.12**. Bring your **own equipment** (laptop, phone, etc.) so you will be able to give your demonstration, including charger(s) and cables etc. If the door of A1.12 is closed you can take a seat on one of the chairs outside. If it is your turn to record your demonstration we will come out to get you. The recording (including installing the equipment) will take about 15 minutes in total.
