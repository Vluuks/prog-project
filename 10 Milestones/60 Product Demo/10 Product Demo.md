## Demonstrations

You are to present your final product on Friday. To make your fellow students
and your mentor fully understand what you have built, prepare a brief demo of all relevant features. The demonstrations will be used to consider the *scope* of your project for grading.

Program:

- 13:30--16:30: demonstrations by group
- 16:30--18:00: drinks, snacks and goodbyes!
