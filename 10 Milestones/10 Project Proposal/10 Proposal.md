# Project Proposal

You'll spend the first day building a *problem definition*. An important part of this is
understanding the limitations and possibilities of the platform that you will be building your
software on.

The result of this phase is a *proposal document* that thorougly describes the
folowing aspects of your application:

- what features will be exposed to the end user, what problem will be solved
  for the user

- a preliminary sketch of what the application will look like

- what data sets and data sources will you need, how you will get the data into
  the right form for your app

- what separate parts of the application can be defined (decomposing the
  problem) and how these should work together

- how the platform will facilitate creating your application, and what external
  components (APIs) you need to make certain features possible

- potential problems that may arise during development and what possibilities
  you have to overcome these

- a very short review of similar applications or visualizations in terms of features and possibly technical aspects (what do they offer? how have they implemented it?)

> All documentation and code of this project must be hosted on GitHub and updated daily, in order for the staff to be able to monitor your progress. Please note that the repository must be public!

To create such a document and get your project started, complete the following steps:

1. Go to <https://github.com/new> and create a new code repository. Check the box to initialize the repository with a readme document:

   ![Check Initialize this repository with a README](readme.png)

2. Clone the repository to your computer using **git**. Don't know how? Head to the [reference](/reference/git)!

3. Edit the plain text document called **README.md**. The **.md** extension indicates its *Markdown* formatting style. Have you never written Markdown before? Refer to the [reference](/reference/markdown) for more information. Write your proposal in that document.

   The proposal document should be well-written and clearly formatted. Do not forget to include a
   title, your name, and a paragraph summary of the application goals at the top.

4. As you will need to include some sketches into your proposal, put these images in a **doc** folder inside your repository. (Use exactly that name, for standards' sake!)

5. Discuss the contents of your with fellow students and the teaching crew *before* handing it in!

6. Now, copy the URL of the GitHub page for your project and submit it below. It will be of the form <https://github.com/stgm/project>.

> Don't commit any code yet! Your repository should be clean for us to read, containing the **README.md**, a **doc** folder (exactly that name) and nothing else.
