# Project Proposal

You'll spend the first <strong>day</strong> building a *proposal document*. This document should connect the functional design of your project (what does it do?) to a problem in the real world.

You and others can use this document to estimate the effort required to implement the project. Your project has a high risk of failure if:

- the envisioned app/viz tries to do too much
- the envisioned app/viz doesn't do enough
- the purpose of the app/viz is not well-defined (too vague)

By writing a clear proposal document and getting feedback on it from multiple students and teachers, you can better avoid these risks!

## Problem

- What **problem** will be solved? Keep it two 2-3 lines.

- Who is a **typical member** of your target audience? What are their interests as relevant to your project?

## Solution

- Include a **visual sketch** of what the final product will look like for the user; if you envision the application to have multiple screens, sketch these all out separately.

- Include a list of **main features** that will be available to users. Keep it brief.

- Mark which features define the *minimum viable product* (MVP) and which parts may be optional to implement.

## Prerequisites

- List the data sources that you will use and whether you will need to transform the data before it is usable for your application. The list should include links to where the data sources may be found.

- List the external components (libraries etc.) that you need to make certain features possible (name and URL link).

- Include a review of similar mobile apps or related visualizations, in terms of features and technical aspects: what do they offer? how have they implemented it? can you do it in the same way?.

- List the hardest parts of creating your application: think of technical problems or limitations that could arise during development and what possibilities you have to overcome these.

## Sanity check

Before continuing, compare your solution to the [project requirements](/reference/requirements) one last time.

## GitHub

All documentation and code of this project must be hosted on GitHub and updated
daily, in order for the staff to be able to monitor your progress. Please note
that the repository must be public!

To create such a document and get your project started, complete the following
steps:

1. Go to <https://github.com/new> and create a new code repository. Check the box to initialize the repository with a readme document:

   ![Check Initialize this repository with a README](readme.png)

2. Clone the repository to your computer using **git**. Don't know how? Head to the [reference](/reference/git)!

3. Edit the plain text document called **README.md**. The **.md** extension indicates its *Markdown* formatting style. Have you never written Markdown before? Refer to the [reference](/reference/markdown) for more information. Write your proposal in that document.

   The proposal document should be well-written and clearly formatted. Do not forget to include a
   title, your name, and a paragraph summary of the application goals at the top.

4. As you will need to include some sketches into your proposal, put these images in a **doc** folder inside your repository. (Use exactly that name, for standards' sake!)

5. Discuss the contents of your with fellow students and the teaching crew *before* handing it in!

6. Now, copy the URL of the GitHub page for your project and submit it below. It will be in this format: <https://github.com/stgm/project>.

Don't commit any code yet! Your repository should be clean for us to read, containing the **README.md**, a **doc** folder (exactly that name), pictures in the **doc** folder, and nothing else.

## What's next

The next step in your project is creating a design document. There, you'll describe how your project will be created according to the rules of the application framework that you're using.

Meanwhile, keep an eye on the **GitHub Issues** for your project. This is where you will get feedback on whether your project is acceptable as it is.
