# Project Proposal

You'll spend the first day building a *problem definition*. A part of this is
understanding the limitations and possibilities of the platform that you will
be building your software on.

The result is a *proposal document* that thoroughly describes the following
aspects of your application:

- what problem will be solved for the user

- what features will be available to solve the problem

- an overview sketch of what the application will look like for the user; if you envision the application to have multiple screens, sketch these all out

- what data sets and data sources will you need, how you will get the data into
  the right form for your app

- what separate parts of the application can be defined (decomposing the
  problem) and how these should work together

- what external components (APIs) you need to make certain features possible

- technical problems or limitations that could arise during development and what possibilities you have to overcome these

- a review of similar applications or visualizations in terms of features and technical aspects (what do they offer? how have they implemented it?)

## Minimum viable product

Be sure to make clear which parts of the application define the
*minimum viable product* (MVP) and which parts may be optional to implement.

## GitHub

All documentation and code of this project must be hosted on GitHub and updated
daily, in order for the staff to be able to monitor your progress. Please note
that the repository must be public!

To create such a document and get your project started, complete the following
steps:

1. Go to <https://github.com/new> and create a new code repository. Check the box to initialize the repository with a readme document:

   ![Check Initialize this repository with a README](readme.png)

2. Clone the repository to your computer using **git**. Don't know how? Head to the [reference](/reference/git)!

3. Edit the plain text document called **README.md**. The **.md** extension indicates its *Markdown* formatting style. Have you never written Markdown before? Refer to the [reference](/reference/markdown) for more information. Write your proposal in that document.

   The proposal document should be well-written and clearly formatted. Do not forget to include a
   title, your name, and a paragraph summary of the application goals at the top.

4. As you will need to include some sketches into your proposal, put these images in a **doc** folder inside your repository. (Use exactly that name, for standards' sake!)

5. Discuss the contents of your with fellow students and the teaching crew *before* handing it in!

6. Now, copy the URL of the GitHub page for your project and submit it below. It will be in this format: <https://github.com/stgm/project>.

> Don't commit any code yet! Your repository should be clean for us to read, containing the **README.md**, a **doc** folder (exactly that name), pictures in the **doc** folder, and nothing else.
