# Project Proposal

You'll spend the first couple of days building a *problem definition*. An
important part of this is understanding the limitations and possibilities of
the platform that you will be building your software on.

The result of this phase is a *proposal document* that thorougly describes the
folowing aspects of your application:

- what features will be exposed to the end user, what problem will be solved
  for the user

- a preliminary sketch of what the application will look like

- what data sets and data sources will you need, how you will get the data into
  the right form for your app

- what separate parts of the application can be defined (decomposing the
  problem) and how these should work together

- how the platform will facilitate creating your application, and what external
  components (APIs) you need to make certain features possible

- potential problems that may arise during development and what possibilities
  you have to overcome these

- a very short review of similar applications or visualizations in terms of features and possibly technical aspects (what do they offer? how have they implemented it?)

Create a plain text document called `README.md`. The **.md** extension indicates its *Markdown* formatting style. Have you never written Markdown before? Refer to the [reference](/reference/markdown) for more information. Write your proposal in that document.

The proposal document should be well-written and clearly formatted. Do not
forget to include a title, your name, and a paragraph summary of the
application goals at the top.

Although we call the document a proposal, you are expected to refine and
discuss the contents with fellow students and the teaching crew *before*
handing it in.

> Save your proposal document as `README.md` in the root of your GitHub repository. Put the images in a subfolder called `doc`. Using Markdown and this particular directory structure is compulsory!
