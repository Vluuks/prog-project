## Setting up your development environment (deadline: Tuesday) ##



While working on your problem definition, you can start creating your
development environment. From the pre-proposal, you should know what platform
you will be using and how to test the software during development and
thereafter.

If you have not done so already, you should setup *git* to share your code with
the teaching staff on a daily basis.

Make sure you have a basic project on GitHub containing all boilerplate code
that is generated by the framework that you are using. Also make sure that you
can easily test your application so you will not be slowed down during
development.

*Put the code in a subfolder in your GitHub repository, separate from the `README` etc.*

### Submitting

You will need to submit your boilerplate code by *push*ing it to GitHub.
